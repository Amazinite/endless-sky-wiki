### Available for purchase

The table below contains all the weapons you can purchase in an outfitter prior to completing any special missions. (It might take some exploration to discover where some of them are sold, however!) The "/s" columns are all in units per second; "shield/s" and "hull/s" is the amount of shield or hull damage the weapon does. The "strength" column gives the strength of a missile or of an anti-missile system. For more details on weapon attributes, see the page on [creating outfits](CreatingOutfits).

### Special Weapons

**Spoiler Alert!** This table contains weapons that you cannot purchase at the start of the game. Some of them become available during the course of the Free Worlds story line; some are used by alien species and are only available by plundering alien ships.
