As with the game graphics, my goal is for the sounds to be somewhat understated and simple. I also hope to use real sounds rather than synthesized ones to avoid having them sound artificial, silly, and toy-like. All the sounds are 16-bit mono 44100 Hz .wav files. The OpenAL library adjusts the volume, left / right balance, and pitch (i.e. doppler effect) of the sounds based on their location and velocity relative to the player. There is currently no music or other ambient noise.

This is a list of all sounds currently needed in the game. Sounds that currently exist are in _italics_, but many of those are either tacky and need replacing, or at least need better audio balancing. Many of the existing sounds have been reused for a wide variety of effects; ideally each of those would have a unique sound instead.
